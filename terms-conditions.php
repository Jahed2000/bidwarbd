                                        <h3><strong>Bidding and using AutoBid</strong></h3>
                                        <p>Users can place bids by manually clicking the relevant bid button or using the automatic AutoBid function.
                                            AutoBid lets users bid on an auction even when they are not online or logged in. The AutoBid automatically places bids according to the user’s instructions. For more information on AutoBid, visit the "FAQs" section.
                                            Bids are purchased in advance in the form of "Bid Packs". Bidderboy reserves the right to offer different size Bid Packs at different times; also, Bidderboy could offer free bids at its sole discretion. All placed bids and free bids are non-refundable. All unused credits are non refundable and non transferable.</p>
                                    </li>

                                        <h3><strong>How the Auctions Work</strong></h3>
                                        <p>With each bid placed, the price of the item on which the user is bidding increases by a small preset amount (10 paisa INR to 50 Paisa INR). Each new bid resets the remaining time for an auction up to the amount specified for the Auction Type (usually 10, 20, 30, 50, and 60 seconds or up to 10 Minutes as specified for that particular auction).
                                            When a bid is placed, number of credits are deducted from the user’s bidding account as per the specified number of credits for that auction. Placed bids are not refundable. An auction closes when no more bids are received by Bidderboy’ servers. The countdown time is indicated for each auction. Due to the time it takes for bids to reach Bidderboy’ servers, and in order to allow all users the same opportunity to bid regardless of geographic location, Bidderboy’ servers will wait for an additional 5 seconds for any placed bids to reach Bidderboy servers before closing the auction.
                                            The user who was the last to place a bid wins the auction and can purchase the product.
                                            Bids become valid when they are entered in the Bidderboy database and registered in Bidderboy’ system. Bidderboy is not responsible for disruptions in the user’s connection and errors that may occur as a result of this. This includes, but is not limited to, incorrect countdown of the remaining time, outdated information on bidders, and bids.</p>

                                        <h3><strong>Acceptance of the Win - Payment</strong></h3>
                                        <p>Once an auction is closed, the winner, goes to My Account for information on the total price, including shipping costs, and payment options. Once the auction is closed, the winner has 15 days to pay the total price of the product, by following the steps indicated on the website. After confirming the win and paying the amount due, the winner will receive a confirmation e-mail. Bidderboy will ship the product within 21 days after payment confirmation is received. The buyer must also provide an accurate delivery address on the account, before Bidderboy can ship the product. After Bidderboy has shipped the product, it will take a few days for it to reach the buyer.
                                            If an auction win has not been confirmed and paid within 15 days, the order will be void and cancelled, spent bids will not be refunded.</p>
