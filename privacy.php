                                        <p>Personal data is the information needed to identify you, for example your name, address, date of birth, e-mail address, mobile phone number, etc. With your consent, personal data is recorded and processed by Bidderboy. Also other non-personal information may be stored, such as: when you register with Bidderboy; when you buy credits or items; when you bid on or win an auction; what payment services you use; your IP address. To protect our customers by minimising the number of places your sensitive payment information is stored, Bidderboy ensures that payment account or credit card data other than your billing address is never stored. Our website contains forms that directly pass such information on to our payment processor; the only part stored in our system is the service used, the date of the transaction, if it was successful and any error messages provided by the payment processor. As stated above, Bidderboy’s online services store bidding data with time stamps when credits were placed. This information can be used by Bidderboy for enhancing Bidderboy’s online bidding service. It is important to note that no personal data of a user will ever be shared with any third party or any other Bidderboy user.</p>
